# Predicting the Composer of Classical Music using Computer Vision
> As published on [Medium](https://medium.com/@zachcaceres/deep-learning-can-we-use-computer-vision-to-predict-the-composer-of-classical-music-464dd5516996)

This project used Deep Learning to predict the composer of a piece of classical music using a spectrogram of the composition. Compositions were converted from MIDI to WAV using a single synth. These WAV files were converted to spectrogram and analyzed using Resnet34 and Resnet50.

Notebook available in spectrogram.ipynb.

Supporting scripts in /scripts.

Enjoy!
